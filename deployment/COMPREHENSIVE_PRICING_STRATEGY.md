## Pricing Objection Responses

### Common Objections & Strategic Responses

#### "The price is too high for our budget"
```yaml
Reframe Strategy:
  Focus: "Let's calculate cost per additional deal, not monthly cost"
  
  Calculation Example:
    "At $12,750/month with 22 additional deals, you're paying $579 per additional deal.
    With an average commission of $8,500, that's a 1,468% return on each deal.
    Can you get that return anywhere else?"
    
  Evidence:
    "Our clients typically break even within 2-3 days of their first month.
    After that, it's pure profit - usually 10-15x their investment."
    
  Risk Mitigation:
    "Plus, we guarantee 200% ROI within 60 days, or we refund everything.
    What's the risk? The risk is NOT implementing this technology."

Alternative Solutions:
  - Performance-based pricing option
  - Extended payment terms
  - Pilot program with lower initial investment
  - ROI-sharing model for enterprise clients
```

#### "We need to compare other options"
```yaml
Competitive Response:
  Welcome: "Absolutely - thorough evaluation is critical for this investment."
  
  Unique Value Proposition:
    "Here's what you won't find anywhere else:
    - Sub-30 second voice AI response (no competitor offers this)
    - 24/7 real estate-specific intelligence
    - 200% ROI guarantee (no competitor provides this)
    - 72-hour implementation vs 3-6 months elsewhere"
    
  Urgency Creation:
    "While you're evaluating, you're losing $[daily revenue] per day.
    We can start your trial immediately so you don't lose opportunities."
    
  Risk-Free Positioning:
    "The only risk is delay. Start the 30-day trial while evaluating alternatives.
    If we don't deliver superior results, you have other options and lost no time."

Competitive Battle Card:
  - Feature comparison charts ready
  - ROI differential calculations
  - Implementation timeline comparisons
  - Reference calls from similar clients
```

#### "We're not ready to make a decision now"
```yaml
Discovery Response:
  Understand: "Help me understand what needs to change for this to be a priority."
  Timeline: "What's your timeline for improving lead response and conversion?"
  
  Cost of Delay Calculation:
    "Each month of delay costs you approximately $[monthly additional revenue].
    Over 6 months, that's $[6x monthly] in lost opportunity.
    The cost of waiting often exceeds the cost of the solution."
    
  Risk-Free Progression:
    "You can start the trial while you're deciding.
    There's no commitment, no setup fees, and you'll have real data to guide your decision."
    
  Decision Support:
    "I can provide a comprehensive business case presentation for your team.
    Most decisions get approved quickly once the ROI is clear."

Next Steps Framework:
  1. Schedule trial implementation (immediate)
  2. 30-day performance measurement
  3. Business case presentation to stakeholders  
  4. Decision with complete confidence and data
```

#### "We need approval from ownership/management"
```yaml

    - 15-minute strategic overview
    - ROI calculator customized for their business
    - Competitive analysis and market positioning
    - Risk mitigation and guarantee framework
