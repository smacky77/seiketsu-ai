  Evidence: "Here's what similar companies achieved"

  Alternative: "We also have pilot program options"

Common Objections & Responses:

"We're happy with our current system":
  "That's great that you have a system in place. The question is: could it respond to leads in under 30 seconds at 11 PM on Sunday? That's when you're losing deals to faster competitors."

"We need to compare options":
  "Absolutely - this is an important decision. While you're comparing, can I ask - what other solution offers voice AI with 200% ROI guarantee and 72-hour implementation?"

"We're not ready to make a decision":
  "I understand. Help me understand - what would need to change for improving lead response to become a priority? And what's the cost of waiting while competitors potentially get this advantage first?"

"It sounds too good to be true":
  "I appreciate the healthy skepticism - that's why we provide a 200% ROI guarantee. If we don't deliver the results we promise, you get 100% of your money back plus a $5,000 inconvenience credit."
