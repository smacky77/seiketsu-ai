### Objection Handling Responses

#### Price Objection Responses
```yaml
"It's too expensive":
Response: "Let's look at cost per deal, not monthly cost. At $199/month, if Seiketsu AI helps you close just one additional $300,000 home (earning $9,000 commission), you've paid for 3.75 years of service. Most clients see 2-3 additional closings per month."

"I need to think about it":
Response: "I understand - this is an important decision. What specific concerns can I address? Would a 30-day trial help you see the results risk-free? Many agents see their first converted lead within the first week."

"My current system works fine":
Response: "That's great that you have a system. How quickly does it respond to leads that come in at 11 PM on Sunday? Seiketsu AI doesn't replace what's working - it fills the gaps when you can't be available personally."
```

#### Technology Objection Responses
```yaml
"I'm not tech-savvy":
Response: "That's exactly why we built Seiketsu AI to be simple. Setup takes under 2 hours, and we provide personal training. You don't need to be technical - just like you don't need to understand how your phone works to make calls."

"AI sounds impersonal":
Response: "I understand that concern. Our AI is trained specifically for real estate conversations and sounds completely natural. Would you like to hear a sample conversation? Most people can't tell it's AI until we tell them."

"What if it makes mistakes":
Response: "Great question. The AI handles qualification and initial conversations, then seamlessly transfers qualified leads to you. You maintain complete control over your client relationships while the AI handles the initial heavy lifting."
