## Personalized Outreach Campaigns

### LinkedIn Outreach Strategy

#### Message Sequence Templates

**Initial Connection Request:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed your focus on innovation at [Company] and thought you'd be interested in how top real estate companies are using AI to transform lead response times from hours to seconds.

We're helping brokerages like yours increase lead conversion by 40% with voice AI that never sleeps. Would love to connect and share some insights.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Follow-up Message (Day 3):**
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting! I saw [Company's] recent growth announcement - congratulations on the expansion.

I'd love to show you how [Similar Company] increased their lead conversion 35% in just 30 days using our AI voice agent. It responds to leads in under 30 seconds, 24/7.

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick demo? I can show you exactly how it would work for [Company].

The ROI calculator alone is worth the conversation.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Value-Add Message (Day 7):**
```
Hi [First Name],

73% of leads go to the agent who responds first, but most agents take 6+ hours to respond.

I just published a case study showing how [Client Name] went from 6-hour response times to 30 seconds with our AI voice agent - and saw a 42% increase in conversions.

[Link to case study]

Thought this might interest you given [Company's] focus on agent productivity. Happy to discuss how this could work for your team.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email Campaign Sequences

#### Cold Email Template Series

**Email 1: Problem Identification**
```
Subject: [First Name], are you losing leads to slow response times?

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: What's your average response time to new leads?

If it's longer than 5 minutes, you're likely losing deals to faster competitors.

I work with real estate companies like [Company] to solve this exact problem. We just helped [Similar Company] reduce their response time from 4 hours to 30 seconds - and they saw a 38% increase in conversions.

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see how this could work for you?

[Calendar Link]

Best regards,
[Your Name]
P.S. The demo includes a free ROI calculation for your specific situation.
```

**Email 2: Social Proof (Day 4)**
```
Subject: How [Client Name] increased conversions 40% in 30 days

[First Name],

[Client Name] was skeptical about AI too.

"We didn't think AI could handle real estate conversations," said [Client Contact], "but after seeing 40% higher conversion rates in our first month, we're believers."

Here's what happened:
- Response time: 6 hours → 30 seconds
- Lead conversion: 3.2% → 4.8%  
- Agent productivity: +35%
- Additional revenue: $180K in first quarter

[Link to full case study]

Want to see how this would work for [Company]? I can show you in 15 minutes.

[Calendar Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: Objection Handling (Day 8)**
```
Subject: "But our agents prefer personal touch"

[First Name],

I hear this objection often: "Our clients expect the personal touch."

Here's the thing - our AI doesn't replace your agents. It gets prospects excited to talk to them.

Our voice AI:
✓ Qualifies leads instantly (not at 2 AM when agents sleep)
✓ Schedules appointments with qualified prospects
✓ Hands off warm, engaged leads to your agents
✓ Ensures no lead ever goes uncontacted

Result? Your agents spend time with better prospects instead of chasing cold leads.

[Client Name] told me: "Our agents love it because they're closing more deals with less effort."

Want to see exactly how it works?

[Calendar Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Cold Calling Scripts

#### Call Script Template

**Opening (30 seconds):**
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Seiketsu AI. I know you're busy, so I'll be quick.

I'm calling because we just helped [Similar Company] increase their lead conversion by 40% by reducing response time from hours to seconds.

Do you have 2 minutes for me to explain how this could work for [Company]?"

[Wait for response]

If YES: Continue with value proposition
If NO: "When would be a better time to call? This could add $50K+ to your quarterly revenue."
```

**Value Proposition (60 seconds):**
```
"Great. Here's what we do:

When a lead comes in at 11 PM on Sunday, instead of waiting until Monday morning, our AI voice agent calls them back in 30 seconds. It sounds completely natural and qualifies them for your agents.

[Similar Company] went from 6-hour response times to 30 seconds and saw their conversion rate jump from 3% to 5% - that's an extra $180K in revenue in their first quarter.

The best part? Setup takes under 2 hours and we guarantee results.

Would you like to see a quick demo of how this would work with your lead flow?"
```

**Demo Scheduling:**
```
"Perfect. I can show you exactly how it works in 15 minutes. 

I have time [Day] at [Time] or [Day] at [Time]. Which works better?

I'll also bring a custom ROI calculation for your specific situation - most brokers are surprised by the numbers.

Should I send you a calendar invite?"
```

### Objection Handling Playbook

#### Common Objections & Responses

**"It's too expensive"**
```
Response: "I understand cost is important. Let's look at value instead of price. 

At $199/month, if Seiketsu helps you close just one additional $300K home - earning a $9K commission - you've covered 3.75 years of service.

Most clients see 2-3 additional closings per month. The question isn't whether you can afford it - it's whether you can afford NOT to have it.

Would you like me to show you the exact ROI calculation for your situation?"
```

**"We need to think about it"**
```
Response: "Absolutely - this is an important decision. Help me understand what specific concerns I can address.

Is it the technology, the implementation, or the results?

I can offer a 30-day risk-free trial where we guarantee results. If you don't see measurable improvement, we'll refund every penny.

What would need to happen in the next 30 days for this to be an easy yes?"
```

**"AI sounds impersonal"**
```
Response: "I completely understand that concern. Here's what's interesting - our AI actually makes your service MORE personal.

Instead of leads waiting 6 hours for a response, they get immediate attention. The AI qualifies them and schedules time with your agents when they're most ready to buy.

Would you like to hear what it sounds like? Most people can't tell it's AI until we tell them."

[Play sample conversation]
```

**"We already have a CRM"**
```
Response: "That's great! We're not here to replace your CRM - we enhance it.

Seiketsu plugs into your existing system and makes it work better. When a lead comes in, instead of sitting in your CRM for hours, our AI immediately calls them, qualifies them, and updates your CRM with the results.

Your current CRM captures leads. Seiketsu converts them.

Which CRM are you using? I can show you exactly how the integration works."
