## ROI Calculation Engine

### Core Impact Calculations

#### Response Time Improvement Impact
```javascript
// Response Time ROI Calculation
function calculateResponseTimeImpact(currentResponseTime, leadVolume, conversionRate) {
  const responseTimeMultipliers = {
    '5 minutes': 1.0,
    '30 minutes': 1.15,
    '1 hour': 1.25,
    '2-4 hours': 1.40,
    '4-8 hours': 1.65,
    '8+ hours': 2.00
  };
  
  const currentMultiplier = responseTimeMultipliers[currentResponseTime] || 1.4;
  const seiketsuMultiplier = 1.0; // <30 second response
  
  const improvementFactor = currentMultiplier / seiketsuMultiplier;
  const improvedConversionRate = conversionRate * improvementFactor;
  
  return {
    originalConversions: leadVolume * (conversionRate / 100),
    improvedConversions: leadVolume * (improvedConversionRate / 100),
    additionalConversions: leadVolume * ((improvedConversionRate - conversionRate) / 100)
  };
}
```

#### 24/7 Availability Impact
```javascript
// After-Hours Lead Capture
function calculateAvailabilityImpact(leadVolume, workingHours) {
  const weeklyHours = 168; // Total hours in week
  const availableHours = workingHours;
  const unavailableHours = weeklyHours - availableHours;
  
  const afterHoursLeadPercentage = unavailableHours / weeklyHours;
  const afterHoursLeads = leadVolume * afterHoursLeadPercentage;
  
  // 40% of after-hours leads are lost without immediate response
  const recoveredLeads = afterHoursLeads * 0.40;
  
  return {
    afterHoursLeads,
    recoveredLeads,
    additionalOpportunity: recoveredLeads
  };
}
```

#### Lead Quality Enhancement
```javascript
// AI Qualification Impact
function calculateQualificationImpact(leadVolume, conversionRate) {
  // AI pre-qualification improves agent efficiency
  const qualificationImprovement = 1.25; // 25% better qualified leads
  const agentEfficiencyGain = 1.30; // 30% more productive time
  
  const qualifiedLeadImpact = conversionRate * qualificationImprovement;
  const efficiencyImpact = qualifiedLeadImpact * agentEfficiencyGain;
  
  return {
    improvedQualification: qualificationImprovement,
    efficiencyGain: agentEfficiencyGain,
    totalImpact: efficiencyImpact
  };
}
```

### Revenue Impact Calculations

#### Monthly Revenue Projection
```javascript
// Complete Monthly Revenue Calculation
function calculateMonthlyRevenue(inputs) {
  const {
    leadVolume,
    currentResponseTime,
    conversionRate,
    avgCommission,
    workingHours,
    agentCount
  } = inputs;
  
  // Current baseline
  const currentConversions = leadVolume * (conversionRate / 100);
  const currentRevenue = currentConversions * avgCommission;
  
  // Response time improvement
  const responseImpact = calculateResponseTimeImpact(
    currentResponseTime, leadVolume, conversionRate
  );
  
  // Availability improvement
  const availabilityImpact = calculateAvailabilityImpact(leadVolume, workingHours);
  
  // Qualification improvement
  const qualificationImpact = calculateQualificationImpact(leadVolume, conversionRate);
  
  // Total additional conversions
  const totalAdditionalConversions = 
    responseImpact.additionalConversions +
    availabilityImpact.additionalOpportunity * (conversionRate / 100) +
    (currentConversions * (qualificationImpact.totalImpact - 1));
  
  const additionalRevenue = totalAdditionalConversions * avgCommission;
  const totalRevenue = currentRevenue + additionalRevenue;
  
  return {
    currentRevenue,
    additionalRevenue,
    totalRevenue,
    improvementPercentage: (additionalRevenue / currentRevenue) * 100
  };
}
```

#### Annual ROI Calculation
```javascript
// Annual ROI and Payback Analysis
function calculateAnnualROI(monthlyRevenue, seiketsuCost, agentCount) {
  const annualAdditionalRevenue = monthlyRevenue.additionalRevenue * 12;
  const annualSeiketsuCost = seiketsuCost * 12 * agentCount;
  
  const roi = ((annualAdditionalRevenue - annualSeiketsuCost) / annualSeiketsuCost) * 100;
  const paybackMonths = annualSeiketsuCost / monthlyRevenue.additionalRevenue;
  
  return {
    annualAdditionalRevenue,
    annualCost: annualSeiketsuCost,
    netGain: annualAdditionalRevenue - annualSeiketsuCost,
    roi,
    paybackMonths
  };
}
```
