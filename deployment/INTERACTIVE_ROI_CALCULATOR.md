## ROI Calculation Engine

### Core Impact Formulas

#### Response Time Improvement Impact
```javascript
// JavaScript calculation logic
function calculateResponseTimeImpact(currentResponseTime, leadVolume, conversionRate) {
  const responseTimeMultipliers = {
    "Under 30 minutes": 1.0,
    "30 minutes - 2 hours": 1.25,
    "2-6 hours": 1.65,
    "6-24 hours": 2.20,
    "24+ hours": 3.00
  };
  
  const currentMultiplier = responseTimeMultipliers[currentResponseTime] || 1.65;
  const seiketsuMultiplier = 1.0; // <30 second response
  
  const improvementFactor = currentMultiplier;
  const improvedConversionRate = Math.min(conversionRate * improvementFactor, 15); // Cap at 15%
  
  return {
    currentConversions: leadVolume * (conversionRate / 100),
    improvedConversions: leadVolume * (improvedConversionRate / 100),
    additionalConversions: leadVolume * ((improvedConversionRate - conversionRate) / 100),
    improvementPercentage: ((improvedConversionRate - conversionRate) / conversionRate) * 100
  };
}

// Example calculation:
// 300 leads/month, 6-hour response time, 3.5% conversion
// Improvement factor: 1.65
// New conversion rate: 5.8% (65% improvement)
// Additional conversions: 6.9 per month
```

#### 24/7 Availability Impact
```javascript
function calculateAvailabilityImpact(leadVolume, workingHours) {
  const weeklyHours = 168; // Total hours in week
  const availableHours = Math.min(workingHours, 80); // Cap at 80 hours
  const unavailableHours = weeklyHours - availableHours;
  
  const afterHoursLeadPercentage = unavailableHours / weeklyHours;
  const afterHoursLeads = leadVolume * afterHoursLeadPercentage;
  
  // Research shows 60% of after-hours leads are lost without immediate response
  const recoveredLeads = afterHoursLeads * 0.60;
  
  return {
    currentlyMissedLeads: afterHoursLeads,
    recapturedLeads: recoveredLeads,
    additionalOpportunity: recoveredLeads
  };
}

// Example calculation:
// 300 leads/month, 50 working hours/week
// After-hours leads: 178 (59% of total)
// Recovered leads: 107 additional opportunities
```

#### AI Qualification Enhancement
```javascript
function calculateQualificationImpact(leadVolume, conversionRate) {
  // AI improves lead quality through intelligent qualification
  const qualificationImprovement = 1.20; // 20% better qualified leads
  const agentEfficiencyGain = 1.25; // 25% more productive time
  
  const baselineConversions = leadVolume * (conversionRate / 100);
  const qualityAdjustedConversions = baselineConversions * qualificationImprovement;
  const efficiencyAdjustedConversions = qualityAdjustedConversions * agentEfficiencyGain;
  
  return {
    qualificationImprovement: (qualificationImprovement - 1) * 100,
    efficiencyGain: (agentEfficiencyGain - 1) * 100,
    totalAdditionalConversions: efficiencyAdjustedConversions - baselineConversions
  };
}

// Example calculation:
// 300 leads/month, 3.5% conversion (10.5 deals)
// Quality improvement: +2.1 deals
// Efficiency improvement: +3.2 deals  
// Total additional: +5.3 deals/month
```

### Comprehensive ROI Calculation
```javascript
function calculateComprehensiveROI(inputs) {
  const {
    leadVolume,
    currentResponseTime,
    conversionRate,
    avgCommission,
    teamSize,
    workingHours
  } = inputs;
  
  // Current baseline
  const currentConversions = leadVolume * (conversionRate / 100);
  const currentRevenue = currentConversions * avgCommission;
  
  // Response time improvement
  const responseImpact = calculateResponseTimeImpact(
    currentResponseTime, leadVolume, conversionRate
  );
  
  // Availability improvement
  const availabilityImpact = calculateAvailabilityImpact(leadVolume, workingHours);
  
  // Qualification improvement
  const qualificationImpact = calculateQualificationImpact(leadVolume, conversionRate);
  
  // Total additional conversions (avoid double-counting)
  const totalAdditionalConversions = Math.max(
    responseImpact.additionalConversions,
    availabilityImpact.additionalOpportunity * (conversionRate / 100),
    qualificationImpact.totalAdditionalConversions
  );
  
  const additionalRevenue = totalAdditionalConversions * avgCommission;
  const totalRevenue = currentRevenue + additionalRevenue;
  
  // Determine pricing tier
  const seiketsuCost = calculateSeiketsuCost(teamSize);
  
  return {
    currentMonthlyRevenue: currentRevenue,
    additionalMonthlyRevenue: additionalRevenue,
    totalMonthlyRevenue: totalRevenue,
    improvementPercentage: (additionalRevenue / currentRevenue) * 100,
    monthlyCost: seiketsuCost,
    monthlyROI: ((additionalRevenue - seiketsuCost) / seiketsuCost) * 100,
    annualROI: (((additionalRevenue - seiketsuCost) * 12) / (seiketsuCost * 12)) * 100,
    paybackDays: (seiketsuCost / (additionalRevenue / 30)),
    additionalConversions: totalAdditionalConversions
  };
}

function calculateSeiketsuCost(teamSize) {
  if (teamSize <= 12) return 5950; // Growth Accelerator (minimum 15 agents)
  if (teamSize <= 35) return 12750; // Market Leader
  return 24500; // Enterprise Partnership
}
```
