2. **Start Redis server** for caching functionality
3. **Start Celery workers** for background processing:
   ```bash
   celery -A app.tasks.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
   celery -A app.tasks.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
   ```
4. **Run pre-generation** for your voice agents:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/streaming/pregenerate" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"voice_agent_id": "your_agent_id", "language": "en"}'
   ```
5. **Monitor performance** via the health endpoints and 21dev.ai dashboards
