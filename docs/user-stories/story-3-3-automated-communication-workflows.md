## Epic Context
**Epic 3:** Advanced Real Estate Market Intelligence & Automated Communication

## Story Overview
**As a** real estate professional using Seiketsu AI  
**I want** automated communication workflows that trigger based on client behavior and market events  
**So that** I can maintain consistent client engagement, nurture leads effectively, and deliver timely market insights without manual intervention

## Story Details

### Business Value
- **Primary:** Reduce manual communication overhead by 80% while increasing client engagement
- **Secondary:** Improve lead conversion rates through consistent, personalized follow-ups
- **Tertiary:** Scale communication capabilities without proportional increase in staff

### Story Size: Medium (2-4 hours)
- **Complexity:** Moderate - workflow engine with triggers and templates
- **Risk:** Low - building on existing communication infrastructure
- **Dependencies:** Stories 3.1 (Market Analysis) and 3.2 (Property Valuation) for data triggers

## BMAD Implementation

### B - Behavior (User Actions)
```
Primary Flows:
1. Agent configures workflow triggers (property alerts, market changes, client milestones)
2. System monitors client interactions and market events
3. Workflows auto-trigger based on predefined conditions
4. Personalized communications sent via preferred channels
5. Agent reviews workflow performance and optimization suggestions

Secondary Flows:
- Bulk workflow setup for client segments
- A/B testing different communication sequences
- Integration with existing CRM systems
- Compliance checking for communication content
```

### M - Mechanics (System Behavior)
```
Workflow Engine:
- Event-driven trigger system
- Template-based communication generation
- Multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, voice, in-app)
- Personalization using client data and AI insights
- Performance tracking and optimization

Communication Types:
- Market update alerts
- Property recommendation sequences
- Follow-up drip campaigns
- Milestone celebration messages
- Educational content delivery

Automation Rules:
- Time-based triggers (weekly market updates)
