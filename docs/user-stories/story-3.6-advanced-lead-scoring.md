# Story 3.6: Advanced Lead Scoring

## Epic Context
**Epic 3: Advanced Real Estate Market Intelligence & Automated Communication**

**Story Position:** 6/6 (Final Story - Epic Completion)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours
**Priority:** High

## User Story

**As a** real estate voice agent
**I want** an advanced ML-powered lead scoring system with real-time behavioral analytics
**So that** I can intelligently prioritize leads, predict conversion likelihood, and optimize follow-up strategies for maximum ROI

## BMAD Method Implementation

### Business Value
- **Revenue Impact:** 35-50% increase in conversion rates through intelligent lead prioritization
- **Efficiency Gains:** 60% reduction in time spent on low-quality leads
- **Competitive Advantage:** ML-powered insights unavailable in traditional CRM systems
- **Cost Savings:** $2,000+ monthly savings through optimized agent time allocation
- **Scale Enablement:** Automated scoring handles 10,000+ leads simultaneously

### Motivation
Real estate agents waste 70% of their time on leads that won't convert. Current scoring systems use basic demographic data, missing crucial behavioral signals and market context. Voice agents need intelligent prioritization to maximize their limited interaction time and focus on high-intent prospects.
