## Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### Detection Methods
1. **Automated Monitoring**: Alerts from monitoring systems
2. **Customer Reports**: Support tickets or direct communication
3. **Team Discovery**: Engineers notice issues during development
4. **External Monitoring**: Third-party uptime monitoring

#### Initial Response Checklist
```markdown
## Immediate Actions (First 5 minutes)
- [ ] Acknowledge alert/report within 2 minutes
- [ ] Assess initial severity level
- [ ] Create incident ticket in Jira/PagerDuty
- [ ] Notify incident response team
- [ ] Begin initial investigation

## Assessment Actions (5-15 minutes)
- [ ] Confirm impact scope and affected users
- [ ] Verify system status dashboard accuracy
- [ ] Check recent deployments and changes
- [ ] Review monitoring graphs and logs
- [ ] Update severity level if needed
- [ ] Escalate if P0/P1 and no immediate fix
```

#### Incident Declaration
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Incident declaration script

incident_id=$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
severity=$1
title="$2"

echo "Declaring incident: INC-${incident_id}"
echo "Severity: ${severity}"
echo "Title: ${title}"

# Create incident ticket
curl -X POST "https://api.seiketsu.ai/incidents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  -d "{
    \"id\": \"INC-${incident_id}\",
    \"severity\": \"${severity}\",
    \"title\": \"${title}\",
    \"status\": \"investigating\",
    \"created_at\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"
  }"

# Notify team
slack-notify "#incidents" "🚨 INCIDENT DECLARED: INC-${incident_id} (${severity}): ${title}"

# Page on-call for P0/P1
if [[ "$severity" =~ ^(P0|P1)$ ]]; then
  pagerduty-trigger "${incident_id}" "${severity}" "${title}"
fi
```

### Phase 2: Investigation and Mitigation (15 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Investigation Methodology
1. **Timeline Reconstruction**: What changed recently?
2. **Log Analysis**: Error patterns and anomalies
3. **Metrics Review**: Performance and availability data
4. **Component Testing**: Isolate failing systems
5. **Database Health**: Query performance and data integrity

#### Mitigation Strategies

        for check in self.checks:
            try:
                response = requests.get(check['url'], timeout=10)
                passed = response.status_code == check['expected_status']
                
                results['checks'].append({
                    'name': check['name'],
                    'status': 'PASS' if passed else 'FAIL',
                    'response_time': response.elapsed.total_seconds(),

                })
                
                if not passed:
                    results['all_passed'] = False
                    
            except Exception as e:
                results['checks'].append({
                    'name': check['name'],
                    'status': 'ERROR',
