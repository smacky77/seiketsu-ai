### Emergency Approval Authority
```markdown
## On-Call Emergency Powers
**Who**: Designated on-call engineer
**When**: Critical production issues (P0/P1)
**Scope**: Can deploy fixes without standard approvals
**Limitations**: 
- Must be genuine emergency
- Limited to minimal fix scope
- Requires immediate post-deployment review
- Must notify leadership within 30 minutes

## Emergency Contact Chain
1. On-call Engineer (immediate)
2. Tech Lead (within 15 minutes)
3. Engineering Manager (within 30 minutes)
4. CTO (within 1 hour)
5. CEO (for customer-impacting issues)
```

### Post-Emergency Review Process
All emergency deployments require:
1. **Immediate Review** (within 24 hours)
2. **Root Cause Analysis** (within 48 hours)
3. **Process Improvement Plan** (within 1 week)
4. **Team Learning Session** (within 2 weeks)

### Deployment Approval Dashboard
```typescript
// Approval tracking system
interface DeploymentApproval {
  deploymentId: string;
  environment: 'staging' | 'pre-production' | 'production';
  component: string;
  version: string;
  requestedBy: string;
  approvers: ApprovalStatus[];

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers
```yaml
# Automated rollback configuration
rollback_triggers:
  health_check_failure:
    threshold: 3_consecutive_failures
    action: automatic_rollback
    notification: immediate
  
  error_rate_spike:
    threshold: 5_percent_increase
    window: 5_minutes
    action: automatic_rollback
    notification: immediate
  
  performance_degradation:
    threshold: 50_percent_slower
    window: 10_minutes
    action: automatic_rollback
    notification: immediate
```

### Manual Rollback Authority
```markdown
## Rollback Decision Authority
- **Immediate Rollback**: On-call engineer (no approval needed)
- **Planned Rollback**: Release manager approval
- **Database Rollback**: CTO approval required
- **Infrastructure Rollback**: DevOps lead + CTO approval
```

## Metrics and Reporting

### Deployment Success Metrics
```sql
-- Deployment metrics dashboard query
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('week', deployed_at) as deployment_week,
  environment,
  COUNT(*) as total_deployments,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 END) as successful_deployments,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN rollback_required THEN 1 END) as rollbacks_required,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (deployed_at - requested_at))/3600) as avg_approval_time_hours
FROM deployments
WHERE deployed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months'
GROUP BY deployment_week, environment
ORDER BY deployment_week DESC;
```

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Target >99%
- **Average Approval Time**: Target <4 hours
- **Rollback Rate**: Target <2%
- **Emergency Deployment %**: Target <5%
- **Deployment Frequency**: Target 2-3x per week

## Compliance and Audit Trail

### Audit Documentation Requirements
```markdown
## Required Documentation for Each Production Deployment
- [ ] Change request with business justification
- [ ] Technical review and approval records
- [ ] Security and compliance review results
- [ ] Testing evidence and sign-off
- [ ] Deployment plan and runbook
- [ ] Rollback plan and testing evidence
- [ ] Post-deployment verification results
- [ ] Any issues or incidents during deployment
```

### Regulatory Compliance
- **SOC 2**: All deployments logged with approver identity
- **ISO 27001**: Change management process documented
- **GDPR**: Privacy impact assessments for data changes
- **Industry Standards**: Real estate compliance requirements met

This deployment approval chain ensures safe, coordinated production releases while maintaining the velocity needed for competitive advantage in the real estate AI market.
