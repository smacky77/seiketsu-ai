# Story 3.5: Calendar Scheduling System

**Epic:** 3 - Advanced Real Estate Market Intelligence & Automated Communication  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Time Estimate:** 2-4 hours  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Stories 3.1-3.4 (Market Analysis, Property Valuation, Automated Workflows, Email/SMS)

## User Story

**As a** real estate agent using Seiketsu AI voice platform  
**I want** an intelligent calendar scheduling system that can book appointments during voice conversations  
**So that** I can automatically schedule property showings, client consultations, and follow-up meetings without manual intervention, increasing my booking rate by 40% and reducing scheduling friction.

## Business Value

- **Immediate ROI:** Reduce scheduling time from 5 minutes to 30 seconds per appointment
- **Conversion Impact:** Capture 35% more appointments by eliminating scheduling friction
- **Agent Efficiency:** Free up 2 hours daily from manual calendar management
- **Client Experience:** Instant booking confirmation with zero wait time

## BMAD Method Implementation

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**Given** a voice agent is having a conversation with a potential client  
**When** the client expresses interest in scheduling an appointment  
**Then** the system should immediately check availability and book the appointment  
**And** send confirmation to both parties within 10 seconds

### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

**Core Features (2-hour implementation):**
1. Real-time availability checking
2. Voice-triggered appointment booking
3. Automated confirmation system
4. Basic calendar integration

**Excluded from MVP:**
- Advanced timezone handling
- Complex rescheduling workflows
- Integration with external CRM systems
- Multi-agent scheduling coordination

### Acceptance-Driven Design (ADD)

**Primary Acceptance Criteria:**

**AC 3.5.1: Voice-Triggered Scheduling**
- Voice agent can check availability in real-time during conversation
- System books appointments with 2-3 voice commands
- Handles common scheduling phrases ("next Tuesday", "this afternoon")
- Provides immediate verbal confirmation with details

**AC 3.5.2: Calendar Integration**
- Integrates with Google Calendar API for availability checking
- Creates calendar events with property details and client information
- Blocks time slots immediately upon booking
- Syncs across all agent devices within 30 seconds

**AC 3.5.3: Automated Confirmations**
- Sends SMS confirmation to client within 10 seconds
- Emails calendar invite with property address and meeting details
- Includes cancellation/rescheduling links
- Logs all scheduling activities in system

**AC 3.5.4: Availability Management**
- Displays agent's real-time availability
- Handles buffer times between appointments (15-minute minimum)
- Prevents double-booking automatically
- Shows next 7 days of available slots

### Design-First Approach (DFA)

**User Experience Design:**
```
Voice Flow:
Agent: "Would you like to schedule a viewing?"
Client: "Yes, tomorrow afternoon works"
System: "I have 2 PM or 4 PM available tomorrow. Which works better?"
Client: "2 PM is perfect"
System: "Great! I've booked Tuesday, March 5th at 2 PM for 123 Main St. You'll receive a confirmation text shortly."
```

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** React component for calendar widget
- **Backend:** FastAPI endpoint for scheduling logic
- **Integration:** Google Calendar API for real-time sync
- **Voice:** Enhanced speech recognition for date/time parsing
- **Notifications:** Twilio SMS + Email service

## Test Cases

### TC 3.5.1: Basic Voice Scheduling
```gherkin
Given agent is speaking with client about property showing
When client says "Can we schedule for tomorrow at 2 PM?"
Then system checks availability for specified time
And books appointment if available
And confirms verbally "Scheduled for Tuesday, March 5th at 2 PM"
And sends SMS confirmation within 10 seconds
```

### TC 3.5.2: Conflict Resolution
```gherkin
Given agent has existing appointment at requested time
When client requests booking for conflicting slot
Then system responds "That time isn't available, I have 1 PM or 3 PM open"
And provides alternative options
And waits for client selection
```

### TC 3.5.3: Calendar Sync Validation
```gherkin
Given appointment is booked through voice system
When appointment is created
Then Google Calendar shows new event within 30 seconds
And event includes property address and client details
And calendar invite is sent to client email
```

### TC 3.5.4: Natural Language Processing
```gherkin
Given client uses natural language for scheduling
When client says "How about next Tuesday afternoon?"
Then system interprets as next Tuesday between 12 PM - 5 PM
And provides specific available time slots
And handles booking once time is confirmed
```

## Performance Criteria

- **Accuracy:** 95% correct interpretation of date/time requests
