### API Design

#### Team Management Endpoints
```typescript
// Team CRUD operations
POST   /api/teams                 // Create new team
GET    /api/teams                 // List user's teams
GET    /api/teams/:id             // Get team details
PUT    /api/teams/:id             // Update team
DELETE /api/teams/:id             // Delete team

// Team member management
POST   /api/teams/:id/members     // Add team member
GET    /api/teams/:id/members     // List team members
PUT    /api/teams/:id/members/:uid // Update member role
DELETE /api/teams/:id/members/:uid // Remove member

// Workspace management
POST   /api/teams/:id/workspaces  // Create workspace
GET    /api/teams/:id/workspaces  // List workspaces
PUT    /api/workspaces/:id        // Update workspace
DELETE /api/workspaces/:id        // Delete workspace
```

#### Real-time Collaboration Endpoints
```typescript
// WebSocket events
'team:join'           // Join team workspace
'team:leave'          // Leave team workspace
'team:presence'       // Update presence status
'team:activity'       // Broadcast team activity
'lead:assign'         // Lead assignment events
'lead:update'         // Collaborative lead updates
'chat:message'        // Team messaging
'voice:session_share' // Shared voice sessions
```

### Frontend Architecture

#### State Management with Zustand
```typescript
interface TeamCollaborationState {
  // Team state
  activeTeam: Team | null;
  teams: Team[];
  teamMembers: TeamMember[];
  
  // Workspace state
  activeWorkspace: Workspace | null;
  workspaces: Workspace[];
  sharedLeads: SharedLead[];
  
  // Real-time state
  onlineMembers: string[];
  activities: TeamActivity[];
  presenceData: Record<string, PresenceInfo>;
  
  // Actions
  joinTeam: (teamId: string) => void;
  leaveTeam: () => void;
  updatePresence: (status: PresenceStatus) => void;
  shareLead: (leadId: string, teamId: string) => void;
  assignLead: (leadId: string, userId: string) => void;
  sendMessage: (message: string, teamId: string) => void;
}
```

#### Component Implementation Strategy
```typescript
// Real-time presence component
const TeamPresence: React.FC = () => {
  const { onlineMembers, presenceData } = useTeamStore();
  const { data: members } = useSWR('/api/team/members');
  
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
      {members?.map(member => (
        <PresenceIndicator
          key={member.id}
          user={member}
          isOnline={onlineMembers.includes(member.id)}
          status={presenceData[member.id]?.status}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

// Collaborative lead board
const SharedLeadBoard: React.FC = () => {
  const { sharedLeads, assignLead } = useTeamStore();
  
  const handleDragEnd = (result: DropResult) => {
    if (result.destination?.droppableId === 'assigned') {
      assignLead(result.draggableId, result.destination.data);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <DragDropContext onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        <LeadColumn title="Unassigned" leads={unassignedLeads} />
        <LeadColumn title="In Progress" leads={inProgressLeads} />
        <LeadColumn title="Completed" leads={completedLeads} />
      </div>
    </DragDropContext>
  );
};
```
