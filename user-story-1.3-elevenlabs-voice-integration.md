## Test Cases

### Functional Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Voice Synthesis Basic Flow
**Scenario**: Admin configures and tests voice synthesis
```
GIVEN: Client has valid ElevenLabs configuration
WHEN: Admin initiates voice test with "Hello, this is a test"
THEN: High-quality audio is generated and streamed
AND: Audio plays seamlessly in browser
AND: Response time is <500ms
```

#### Test Case 2: Voice Configuration Management
**Scenario**: Admin customizes voice settings
```
GIVEN: Admin is in voice configuration panel
WHEN: Admin selects "Professional Rachel" voice with 0.7 stability
AND: Admin saves configuration
THEN: Settings are persisted to database
AND: Test synthesis uses new voice settings
AND: All future conversations use updated voice
```

#### Test Case 3: Real-Time Voice Streaming
**Scenario**: Live conversation with voice responses
```
GIVEN: Active voice conversation session
WHEN: AI agent generates response text
THEN: Text is synthesized to audio in real-time

AND: Conversation flow remains natural
```

#### Test Case 4: Error Handling and Fallback
**Scenario**: ElevenLabs API unavailable
```
GIVEN: ElevenLabs API returns 503 error
